# Concurrency

- this is the execution of multiple commands at the same time.
- when these computations interact or affect one another, there is added complexity that must be dealt with, such as [[race-condition|race conditions]] or [[deadlock|deadlocks]].

```dataview
table without id file.inlinks as Backlinks
where file.name = this.file.name
```
