# read committed

Read committed isolation is an isolation level that promises to stop both **dirty reads** and **dirty writes**.

A dirty read occurs when Bob reads a value that Alice is in the process of writing, before she has committed the transaction.

A dirty write occurs when Bob writes to a value that Alice has written to, but has not yet committed. This causes Aliceâ€™s value to be overwritten.
