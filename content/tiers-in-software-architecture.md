# Tiers In Software Architecture

- software systems can be divided into a couple different categories, based on the number of tiers they have:
	- [[single-tier-application]].
	- [[two-tier-application]].
	- [[three-tier-application]].
	- [[n-tier-application]].

> [!warning]+ layers vs. tiers
> although often used interchangeably, donâ€™t confuse layers with tiers!
> - layers are more used to represent the *conceptual/logical organization of the code.*
> - tiers are used to represent the physical separation of components.
