# React.GG Course

- Declarative vs. Imperative
	- Declarative programming is when you tell the program what you want it to do, but don’t necessarily directly tell the computer how to achieve it.
		- Most declarative interfaces have abstracted away the imperative logic.
	- Writing MIPS is the clearest example of strict imperative programming.
	- Using functional programming techniques such as `map` and `reduce` is a declarative paradigm.
	- React is designed to allow for declarative programming of interactive websites.
	 - Declarative code is normally less dependent on context and more generalizable *(because you’re not specifying exactly what the computer should do, step by step)*.
