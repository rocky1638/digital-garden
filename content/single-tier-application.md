# Single Tier Application

- an application where the user interface, backend, and [[database]] reside in the same machine.

## Advantages.

- no network [[latency]].

## Disadvantages.

- the application publisher cannot update code unless the end user decides to update their own app.
	- this was the issue with video games in the 90s, where game studios couldn’t proactively update code that they had already shipped.
- performance heavily depends on the strength of the user’s machine.

table without id file.inlinks as Backlinks
where file.name = this.file.name
