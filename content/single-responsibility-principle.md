# Single Responsibility Principle

- each component in a system should have a single dedicated responsibility.

## Advantages.

- we can have dedicated teams and repos for each system.
- code in general is easier to understand.
- components are loosely coupled and can be changed without drastically affecting each other.

```dataview
table without id file.inlinks as Backlinks
where file.name = this.file.name
```
