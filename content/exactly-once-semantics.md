# Exactly-Once Semantics

- in [[distributed-systems]], we want nodes to process every message that needs processing exactly once, not too few and not too many times.
- if nodes do not retry when their message isnâ€™t acknowledged, they could potentially miss out on completing the delivery of a message.

- if nodes retry too much, they might send the same message too many times.

- one way to solve this issue is to have the application code on the receiving node do [[deduplication]] to ensure that even if it receives multiples of the same message, it only shows one to the user.
	- so, we can have sent messages be **at-least-once** and receiving nodes to accept **at-most-once.**
 - **exactly-once processing** is possible in [[distributed-systems]], but exactly-once delivery is not.
