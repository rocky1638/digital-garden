# Meta Layoff LinkedIn Post

Hi everyone,

As I’m sure most of you have heard by now, Meta laid off over 11,000 employees on Wednesday morning, and I was unfortunately included in the layoffs.

I was eager to start my career working for a high-impact team at Meta, but unfortunately wasn’t given that opportunity and was let go of before I was even able to join a team. Nonetheless, I’m grateful for the time that I was able to spend at Meta and for all the people I was able to meet during my time there.

I’m now open to work, so if you or anyone you know is looking for a new grad/junior software engineer who’s experienced in full-stack development as well as general software engineering in the New York City area or remotely, please reach out to me on LinkedIn or at rockzhou15@gmail.com.
