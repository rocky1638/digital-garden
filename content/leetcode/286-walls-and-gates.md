You are given anÂ `m x n`Â gridÂ `rooms`Â initialized with these three possible values.

- `-1`Â A wall or an obstacle.
- `0`Â A gate.
- `INF`Â Infinity means an empty room. We use the valueÂ `231 - 1 = 2147483647`Â to representÂ `INF`Â as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less thanÂ `2147483647`.

Fill each empty room with the distance toÂ _its nearest gate_. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled withÂ `INF`.

## solution

We BFS in parallel from all of the gates.

The first time we reach a cell, we must have reached it from the closest gate to it because all the traversals are moving outwards at the same rate.

```python
def wallsAndGates(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> None:
	m, n = len(rooms), len(rooms[0])
	INF = 2147483647
	dirs = [[0,1],[1,0],[0,-1],[-1,0]]

	# start bfs from empty rooms
	q = collections.deque()
	for i in range(m):
		for j in range(n):
			if rooms[i][j] == 0:
				q.append((i, j, 0))
	
	while q:
		i, j, dist = q.popleft()
		for d in dirs:
			ni, nj = i + d[0], j + d[1]
	
			if m > ni >= 0 and n > nj >= 0:
				if rooms[ni][nj] == INF:
					rooms[ni][nj] = dist + 1
					q.append((ni, nj, dist + 1))
```
