# 733. Flood Fill

An image is represented by anÂ `m x n`Â integer gridÂ `image`Â whereÂ `image[i][j]`Â represents the pixel value of the image.

You are also given three integersÂ `sr`,Â `sc`, andÂ `color`. You should perform aÂ **flood fill**Â on the image starting from the pixelÂ `image[sr][sc]`.

To perform aÂ **flood fill**, consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connectedÂ **4-directionally**Â to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connectedÂ **4-directionally**Â to those pixels (also with the same color), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels withÂ `color`.

ReturnÂ _the modified image after performing the flood fill_.

```python
class Solution:
    def floodFill(self, image: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, color: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        dirs = [[0,1],[1,0],[0,-1],[-1,0]]
        def dfs(i, j, starting_color):
            if i >= 0  and i < len(image) and j >= 0 and j < len(image[0]) and image[i][j] == starting_color and image[i][j] != color:
                image[i][j] = color
                for d in dirs:
                    dfs(i+d[0], j+d[1], starting_color)
        
        starting_color = image[sr][sc]
        dfs(sr, sc, starting_color)
        return image
```

- just a simple [[dfs]] and change the value of the neighboring nodes.
