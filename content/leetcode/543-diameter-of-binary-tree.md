# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

Given theÂ `root`Â of a binary tree, returnÂ _the length of theÂ **diameter**Â of the tree_.

TheÂ **diameter**Â of a binary tree is theÂ **length**Â of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through theÂ `root`.

TheÂ **length**Â of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

```python
# at each recursion, return the max height of the tree
class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        def recurse(node):
            nonlocal max_diameter
            if node:
                hl = recurse(node.left)
                hr = recurse(node.right)
                diameter = hl + hr

                max_diameter = max(max_diameter, diameter)
                return max(hl, hr) + 1
            
            return 0
        
        recurse(root)
        return max_diameter
```

- the max diameter centered at any node is equal to the sum of the max heights of the left and right subtrees.
- when we recurse, we return the max height of the subtree of the current node.
