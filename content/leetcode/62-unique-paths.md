There is a robot on anÂ `m x n`Â grid. The robot is initially located at theÂ **top-left corner**Â (i.e.,Â `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to theÂ **bottom-right corner**Â (i.e.,Â `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integersÂ `m`Â andÂ `n`, returnÂ _the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner_.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal toÂ `2 * 109`.

## solution

We can use dynamic programming, where in our `dp` array $dp[i][j]$ represents the number of ways to reach the cell $M[i][j]$.

Then, the number of ways to reach any cell is the total number of ways to reach the cell above and the number of ways to reach the cell to the left.

$$
	dp[i][j] = 
	\begin{cases}
	1, \text{ if } i=0 \text{ and } j=0, \\
	dp[i-1][j]+dp[i][j-1] \text{ otherwise.}
	\end{cases}
$$

```python
def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
	# we can use 2d dp
	# each square can be reached from either above or the left
  
	dp = [[0 for j in range(n)] for i in range(m)]
	dp[0][0] = 1
  
	for i in range(m):
		for j in range(n):
			above = 0
			left = 0
			 
			if (i-1) >= 0:
				above = dp[i-1][j]
			if (j-1) >= 0:
				left = dp[i][j-1]
			dp[i][j] += above + left
  
	return dp[-1][-1]
```
