# 283. Move Zeroes

```python

                break

                # we want the leftmost nonzero that is after a 0
                # (anything before a 0 does not need swapping)

            nums[leftmost_zero], nums[leftmost_nonzero] = nums[leftmost_nonzero], nums[leftmost_zero]

            leftmost_zero += 1
            while leftmost_zero < len(nums) and nums[leftmost_zero] != 0:
                leftmost_zero += 1

            leftmost_nonzero += 1

```

- we use a [[two-pointers]] strategy to swap zeroes to the back of the [[array]].
- keep track of where the leftmost zero is, and where the leftmost nonzero that is *to the right* of a zero is.
	- we donâ€™t need to worry about nonzero numbers that are before any zero, because they do not need to be moved in any way.
