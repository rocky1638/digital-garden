# 322. Coin Change

You are given an integer arrayÂ `coins`Â representing coins of different denominations and an integerÂ `amount`Â representing a total amount of money.

ReturnÂ _the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount_. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, returnÂ `-1`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

```python
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        dp = [0]*(amount+1)
        
        for i in range(1, amount+1):
            m = float("inf")
            for coin in coins:
                if i-coin >= 0 and dp[i-coin] >= 0:
                    m = min(m, dp[i-coin]+1)
            dp[i] = m

        return dp[-1] if dp[-1] != float("inf") else -1
```

- we use [[dynamic-programming]] to keep track of the minimum number of coins required to make each `amount` from 0 to `amount`.
- let $d_i$ be the value of the `dp` array at `i`.
- let $C$ be the set of coin values, and $c_i$ be the value of the coin at index $i$ in the `coins` array.
- then, our recursive relation is as follows:

$$
M_i=
\begin{cases}
1 \text{ if } i \in C, \\
\min(d_{i-c_i}) \forall c_i \in C \text{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
$$
