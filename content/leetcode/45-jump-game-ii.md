# 45. Jump Game II

You are given aÂ **0-indexed**Â array of integersÂ `nums`Â of lengthÂ `n`. You are initially positioned atÂ `nums[0]`.

Each elementÂ `nums[i]`Â represents the maximum length of a forward jump from indexÂ `i`. In other words, if you are atÂ `nums[i]`, you can jump to anyÂ `nums[i + j]`Â where:

- `0 <= j <= nums[i]`Â and
- `i + j < n`

ReturnÂ _the minimum number of jumps to reach_Â `nums[n - 1]`. The test cases are generated such that you can reachÂ `nums[n - 1]`.

```python
class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [float("inf")]*len(nums)
        dp[-1] = 0

        for i in reversed(range(len(nums)-1)):
            for jump in range(i+1, min(len(nums), i+nums[i]+1)):
                if dp[jump] is not None:
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[jump]+1)
        return dp[0]
```

- we just keep track of the minimum number of jumps is required to reach the end from index $i$ in `dp[i]`.
	- our base case is 0 in the final index of the `dp` array.
