# 1700. Number Of Students Unable To Eat Lunch

The school cafeteria offers circular and square sandwiches at lunch break, referred to by numbersÂ `0`Â andÂ `1`Â respectively. All students stand in a queue. Each student either prefers square or circular sandwiches.

The number of sandwiches in the cafeteria is equal to the number of students. The sandwiches are placed in aÂ **stack**. At each step:

- If the student at the front of the queueÂ **prefers**Â the sandwich on the top of the stack, they willÂ **take it**Â and leave the queue.
- Otherwise, they willÂ **leave it**Â and go to the queue's end.

This continues until none of the queue students want to take the top sandwich and are thus unable to eat.

You are given two integer arraysÂ `students`Â andÂ `sandwiches`Â whereÂ `sandwiches[i]`Â is the type of theÂ `iâ€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹th`Â sandwich in the stack (`i = 0`Â is the top of the stack) andÂ `students[j]`Â is the preference of theÂ `jâ€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹â€‹th`Â student in the initial queue (`j = 0`Â is the front of the queue). ReturnÂ _the number of students that are unable to eat._

```python
class Solution:
    def countStudents(self, students: List[int], sandwiches: List[int]) -> int:
        q = deque(students)
        sandwiches.reverse()
        
        skipped = 0
        
        while True:
            if skipped == len(q) or len(sandwiches) == 0:
                return len(q)
            
            if q[0] == sandwiches[-1]:
                q.popleft()
                sandwiches.pop()
                skipped = 0
            
            else:
                q.append(q.popleft()) # move to back of line
                skipped += 1
        
        return len(q)
```

- pretty basic dealing with stacks and queues.
