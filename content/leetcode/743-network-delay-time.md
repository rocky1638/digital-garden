You are given a network ofÂ `n`Â nodes, labeled fromÂ `1`Â toÂ `n`. You are also givenÂ `times`, a list of travel times as directed edgesÂ `times[i] = (ui, vi, wi)`, whereÂ `ui`Â is the source node,Â `vi`Â is the target node, andÂ `wi`Â is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target.

We will send a signal from a given nodeÂ `k`. ReturnÂ _theÂ **minimum**Â time it takes for all the_Â `n`Â _nodes to receive the signal_. If it is impossible for all theÂ `n`Â nodes to receive the signal, returnÂ `-1`.

## solution

This problem is exactly the single-source-shortest-path (SSSP) problem, and can be solved with Djikstraâ€™s algorithm or the Bellman-Ford algorithm.

```python
def networkDelayTime(self, times: List[List[int]], n: int, k: int) -> int:
	g = defaultdict(list)
	for u, v, cost in times:
		g[u].append((cost, v))
	  
	dists = [inf]*n
	dists[k-1] = 0
	pq = [(0, k)]
	while pq:
		cur_cost, cur_node = heappop(pq)
		for cost, neighbor in g[cur_node]:
			total_cost = cur_cost + cost
			if total_cost < dists[neighbor-1]:
				heappush(pq, (total_cost, neighbor))
				dists[neighbor-1] = total_cost

	ans = 0
	for i in range(len(dists)):
		if dists[i] == inf:
			return -1
		ans = max(ans, dists[i])
	return ans
```
