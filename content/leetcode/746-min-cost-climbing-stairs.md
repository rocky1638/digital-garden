# 746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs

You are given an integer arrayÂ `cost`Â whereÂ `cost[i]`Â is the cost ofÂ `ith`Â step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with indexÂ `0`, or the step with indexÂ `1`.

ReturnÂ _the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor_.

```python
class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        # dp[i] is the min cost to reach step i
        dp = [0, 0]

        for i in range(2, len(cost)+1):
            dp.append(min(
                dp[i-1] + cost[i-1],
                dp[i-2] + cost[i-2]
            ))
        return dp[-1]
```

- we just do normal dp.
