# 1122. Relative Sort Array

Given two arraysÂ `arr1`Â andÂ `arr2`, the elements ofÂ `arr2`Â are distinct, and all elements inÂ `arr2`Â are also inÂ `arr1`.

Sort the elements ofÂ `arr1`Â such that the relative ordering of items inÂ `arr1`Â are the same as inÂ `arr2`. Elements that do not appear inÂ `arr2`Â should be placed at the end ofÂ `arr1`Â inÂ **ascending**Â order.

```
Example:
Input: arr1 = [2,3,1,3,2,4,6,7,9,2,19], arr2 = [2,1,4,3,9,6]
Output: [2,2,2,1,4,3,3,9,6,7,19]
```

```python
class Solution:
    def relativeSortArray(self, arr1: List[int], arr2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        ans = []
        c1 = collections.Counter(arr1)
        
        for num in arr2:
            while c1[num] > 0:
                ans.append(num)
                c1[num] -= 1
           
        for key in sorted(c1.keys()):
            for i in range(c1[key]):
                ans.append(key)
                
        return ans
```

- we keep a frequency counter for `arr1`, and just move all the values that match with a value in `arr2` into a new output array.
- then, just sort the rest of the values and append them to the output array.

```dataview
table without id file.inlinks as Backlinks
where file.name = this.file.name
```
