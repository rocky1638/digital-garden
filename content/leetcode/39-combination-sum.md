# 39. Combination Sum

Given an array ofÂ **distinct**Â integersÂ `candidates`Â and a target integerÂ `target`, returnÂ _a list of allÂ **unique combinations**Â of_Â `candidates`Â _where the chosen numbers sum to_Â `target`_._Â You may return the combinations inÂ **any order**.

TheÂ **same**Â number may be chosen fromÂ `candidates`Â anÂ **unlimited number of times**. Two combinations are unique if theÂ frequency of at least one of the chosen numbers is different.

The test cases are generated such that the number of unique combinations that sum up toÂ `target`Â is less thanÂ `150`Â combinations for the given input.

```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        seen = set()
        ans = []
        
        def backtrack(tally, acc, cand_idx):
            key = f"{tally}{str(acc)}"
            if key in seen:
                return
            
            if tally == target:
                ans.append(acc)
            
            elif tally > target:
                return
            
            else:
                for i in range(cand_idx, len(candidates)):
                    cand = candidates[i]
                    newkey = f"{tally}{str(acc+[cand])}"
                    backtrack(tally + cand, acc[:]+[cand], i)
                    seen.add(newkey)
            
        backtrack(0, [], 0)
        return ans
```

- classic [[backtracking]], where we try to assemble valid combinations from the top-down.
- with each recursive call, we go through the list of candidates in order, either choosing to append the current candidate again, or to append the next candidate.
	- if our tally ever equals the target, we take the valid combination and append it to `ans`.
	- else, if our tally is past the target, we can just stop that branch of the backtracking.
