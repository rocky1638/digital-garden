- use [[sorting]] to have the tokens in ascending order.
- use [[two-pointers]] strategy to [[greedy|greedily]] use tokens for power or for score.
	- if we can get a point by spending power, we want to spend the cheapest one first.
	- if we canâ€™t get a point, we want to get the most possible power for sacrificing one score.
	- moving in from the left and right with [[two-pointers]] makes sense to do this.
