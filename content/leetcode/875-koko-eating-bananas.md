# 875. Koko Eating Bananas

Koko loves to eat bananas. There areÂ `n`Â piles of bananas, theÂ `ith`Â pile hasÂ `piles[i]`Â bananas. The guards have gone and will come back inÂ `h`Â hours.

Koko can decide her bananas-per-hour eating speed ofÂ `k`. Each hour, she chooses some pile of bananas and eatsÂ `k`Â bananas from that pile. If the pile has less thanÂ `k`Â bananas, she eats all of them instead and will not eat any more bananas during this hour.

Koko likes to eat slowly but still wants to finish eating all the bananas before the guards return.

ReturnÂ _the minimum integer_Â `k`Â _such that she can eat all the bananas within_Â `h`Â _hours_.

```python
class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], h: int) -> int:
        l, r = 1, max(piles)
        best = float("inf")

        while l <= r: 
            k = (l + r) // 2
            time_to_eat = sum(math.ceil(x/k) for x in piles) 

            if time_to_eat <= h:
                best = min(best, k)
                # try to go lower?
                r = k - 1
            elif time_to_eat > h:
                l = k + 1
        
        return best
```

- we use binary search on the possible eating rates `k`, starting our bounds at 1 and the maximum sized pile of bananas.
