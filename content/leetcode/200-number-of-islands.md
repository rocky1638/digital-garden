# 200. Number of Islands

Given anÂ `m x n`Â 2D binary gridÂ `grid`Â which represents a map ofÂ `'1'`s (land) andÂ `'0'`s (water), returnÂ _the number of islands_.

AnÂ **island**Â is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        ans = 0
        dirs = [[0,1],[1,0],[0,-1],[-1,0]]
        
        def sink(x, y):
            grid[x][y] = 'x'
            
            for d in dirs:
                nx, ny = x + d[0], y + d[1]
                if nx >= 0 and nx < len(grid) and ny >= 0 and ny < len(grid[0]):
                    if grid[nx][ny] == '1':
                        sink(nx, ny)
            
        for i in range(len(grid)):
            for j in range(len(grid[0])):
                if grid[i][j] == '1':
                    ans += 1
                    sink(i, j)
        return ans
```

- classic [[graph]] problem, you can use either [[dfs]] or [[bfs]] to traverse the islands and sink them.
