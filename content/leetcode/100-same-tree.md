# 100. Same Tree

```python
class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        if p is None and q is None: return True
        if p is None or q is None: return False

        if p.val != q.val:
            return False
        
        return self.isSameTree(p.left, q.left) and self.isSameTree(p.right, q.right)
```

- basic [[dfs]] using [[recursion]] with both of the [[binary-tree]].
