# 261. Graph Valid Tree

You have a graph ofÂ `n`Â nodes labeled fromÂ `0`Â toÂ `n - 1`. You are given an integer n and a list ofÂ `edges`Â whereÂ `edges[i] = [ai, bi]`Â indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodesÂ `ai`Â andÂ `bi`Â in the graph.

ReturnÂ `true`Â _if the edges of the given graph make up a valid tree, and_Â `false`Â _otherwise_.

```python
class Solution:
    """
    a tree has no cycles and every node has to be reachable in a single path
    """
    def validTree(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        g = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for a, b in edges:
            g[a].append(b)
            g[b].append(a)
        
        seen = set()
        def recurse(node, parent):
            for neighbor in g[node]:
                if neighbor == parent:
                    continue
                if neighbor in seen:
                    return False

                seen.add(neighbor)
                if not recurse(neighbor, node):
                    return False
            return True

        seen.add(0)
        return recurse(0, -1) and len(seen) == n
```

- a tree is defined as a graph that has no cycles, and contains a path that allows you to reach every node in the graph.
- we can just [[dfs]] or [[bfs]] starting from the first node, and keep track of the nodes that weâ€™ve seen.
	- because the graph is bidirectional, we keep track of what the parent node is in each recursive call, so we donâ€™t detect trivial cycles.
- at the end, if we never see a node that weâ€™ve already seen, and we have visited every node, then we know that our graph is a valid tree.
