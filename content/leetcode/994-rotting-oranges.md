# 994. Rotting Oranges

You are given anÂ `m x n`Â `grid`Â where each cell can have one of three values:

- `0`Â representing an empty cell,
- `1`Â representing a fresh orange, or
- `2`Â representing a rotten orange.

Every minute, any fresh orange that isÂ **4-directionally adjacent**Â to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

ReturnÂ _the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange_. IfÂ _this is impossible, return_Â `-1`.

- [[bfs]] from all rotten oranges at the same time in parallel.
- kind of similar idea to [[542-01-matrix]].
