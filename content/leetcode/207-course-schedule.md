There are a total ofÂ `numCourses`Â courses you have to take, labeled fromÂ `0`Â toÂ `numCourses - 1`. You are given an arrayÂ `prerequisites`Â whereÂ `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]`Â indicates that youÂ **must**Â take courseÂ `bi`Â first if you want to take courseÂ `ai`.

- For example, the pairÂ `[0, 1]`, indicates that to take courseÂ `0`Â you have to first take courseÂ `1`.

ReturnÂ `true`Â if you can finish all courses. Otherwise, returnÂ `false`.

## solution

This is a standard topological sort. A prerequisite course has a directed edge towards the course that requires it.

```python
def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
	g = defaultdict(list)
	ind = Counter()
	
	for a, b in prerequisites:
		# create graph adjacency list
		g[a].append(b)
		# count indegrees for each node
		ind[b] += 1
	
	# push all nodes with indegree 0 into a queue
	q = deque()
	topsort = []
	for node in range(numCourses):
		if ind[node] == 0:
		q.append(node)
	
	# do bfs, but only push new nodes that have
	#   an indegree of 0 (all prereqs met)
	# decrement indegree as you go
	while q:
		cur = q.popleft()
		topsort.append(cur)
		for neighbor in g[cur]:
			ind[neighbor] -= 1
			if ind[neighbor] == 0:
				q.append(neighbor)
	
	return len(topsort) == numCourses
```
