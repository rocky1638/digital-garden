# 701. Insert Into A Binary Search Tree

You are given theÂ `root`Â node of a binary search tree (BST) and aÂ `value`Â to insert into the tree. ReturnÂ _the root node of the BST after the insertion_. It isÂ **guaranteed**Â that the new value does not exist in the original BST.

**Notice**Â that there may existÂ multiple valid ways for theÂ insertion, as long as the tree remains a BST after insertion. You can returnÂ **any of them**.

```python
class Solution:
    def insertIntoBST(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], val: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        def recurse(node):
            if node is None:
                return TreeNode(val)
            
            if node.val < val:
                node.right = recurse(node.right)
                return node
            else:
                node.left = recurse(node.left)
                return node
                
        return recurse(root)
```

- basic recursion, just remember that the new value is always inserted as a leaf.

```dataview
table without id file.inlinks as Backlinks
where file.name = this.file.name
```
