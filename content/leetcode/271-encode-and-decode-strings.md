# 271. Encode And Decode Strings

## Non-ascii delimiter.

```python
class Codec:
    def encode(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
        """Encodes a list of strings to a single string.
        """
        return "\U0001f600".join(strs)
        

    def decode(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
        """Decodes a single string to a list of strings.
        """
        return s.split("\U0001f600") 
```

- for each string, compute its length, and append a four character number in front of it in the encoded string.
- fairly easy and straightforward to decode this.

```dataview
table without id file.inlinks as Backlinks
where file.name = this.file.name
```
