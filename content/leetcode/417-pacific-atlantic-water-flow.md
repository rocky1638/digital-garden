# 417. Pacific Atlantic Water Flow

There is anÂ `m x n`Â rectangular island that borders both theÂ **Pacific Ocean**Â andÂ **Atlantic Ocean**. TheÂ **Pacific Ocean**Â touches the island's left and top edges, and theÂ **Atlantic Ocean**Â touches the island's right and bottom edges.

The island is partitioned into a grid of square cells. You are given anÂ `m x n`Â integer matrixÂ `heights`Â whereÂ `heights[r][c]`Â represents theÂ **height above sea level**Â of the cell at coordinateÂ `(r, c)`.

The island receives a lot of rain, and the rain water can flow to neighboring cells directly north, south, east, and west if the neighboring cell's height isÂ **less than or equal to**Â the current cell's height. Water can flow from any cell adjacent to an ocean into the ocean.

ReturnÂ _aÂ **2D list**Â of grid coordinates_Â `result`Â _where_Â `result[i] = [ri, ci]`Â _denotes that rain water can flow from cell_Â `(ri, ci)`Â _toÂ **both**Â the Pacific and Atlantic oceans_.

```

- we [[bfs]] from both of the coastlines, and if we reach a piece of land while moving uphill from the ocean, then we know that we can flow downhill to both coastlines from this block.
- use another [[matrix]] to keep track of if we reach specific cells from both coastlines.
- at the end, return the coordinates of all the cells that have been reached from both coastlines.
