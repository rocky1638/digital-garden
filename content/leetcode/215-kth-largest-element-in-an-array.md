# 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array

Given an integer arrayÂ `nums`Â and an integerÂ `k`, returnÂ _the_Â `kth`Â _largest element in the array_.

Note that it is theÂ `kth`Â largest element in the sorted order, not theÂ `kth`Â distinct element.

You must solve it inÂ `O(n)`Â time complexity.

```python
class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        heap = []
        for num in nums:
            if len(heap) < k:
                heapq.heappush(heap, num)
            elif num > heap[0]:
                heapq.heappushpop(heap, num)
        return heap[0]
```

- simple [[heap]] problem.
- keep a min-heap of the `k` largest elements of the [[array]].
- at the end, the kth largest element will be at the top of the heap.
