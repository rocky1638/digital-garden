Welcome to my digital garden!

I’m currently primarily interested in studying how large distributed systems function, and as such a lot of my recent notes are on the subject. Check out my learnings and notes on [[system-design]].

Besides studying and notes relevant to my work, I also like to take notes and write summaries on [[readings|books that I have found interesting]].

This is an active work-in-progress.
