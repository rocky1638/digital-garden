![[doodle-garden.png]]

Welcome to my digital garden!

This is a place that‚Äôs primarily for me to take notes on anything that interests me! I take notes using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).

All the information on this website is organized in a Wikipedia-style graph, so feel free to click around by backlinks and the graph view, or use the search function.

As a jumping off point, try starting from one of these notes:

- [[readings]]: Besides studying and notes relevant to my work, I also like to take notes and write summaries on books that I find interesting.
- [[system-design]]: I‚Äôm currently primarily interested in studying how large distributed systems function, and as such a lot of my recent notes are on the subject.
- [[leetcode]]: Check out my notes on Leetcode problems that I solved when I was interview prepping.
- [[korean-grammar-learnings]]: I‚Äôm currently attempting to (very slowly) read Harry Potter in Korean, as a way to learn the language.
- [[cool-fonts]]: I occasionally go down the rabbit hole of customizing my IDE and list the fonts I‚Äôve used/am using here.


This is an active work-in-progress.
