	- Use chunking to allow for parallelized uploads, as well as more efficient versioning (we can avoid re-downloading chunks that havenâ€™t changed).
	- If using multiple leaders to handle file uploads, use version vectors for conflict detection, which can also be helpful for conflict resolution.
	- Store permissions, (maps users to files).
	- Serve chunks from object storage with CDNs to reduce latency.
	- Users can subscribe to file updates through a stream like Kafka, which allows them to constantly receive streams of updates from files that other users (or their other devices) can edit.
