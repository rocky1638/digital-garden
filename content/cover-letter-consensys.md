# Cover Letter Consensys

Hi! I’m a recent computer science graduate from the University of Waterloo who has previously worked at Meta and interned at companies including Tesla, StackAdapt, and Consensys.

I have experience in full-stack web development, especially on JavaScript frameworks with React on the frontend and Node/Express on the backend. I am also proficient in Python and has experience in C++, Java, and Ruby.

I’m excited about the fullstack role at Consensys because it will be a great opportunity for me to grow as a software engineer in not only full stack, but to learn more about blockchain and build at the forefront of a fledgling industry.
